# circular-array-queue
This was an asssignment in Second Year in Object-Oriented Programming: Data Structures and Algorithms.

We had to write a class that implemented the `Queue` interface.
This class had to be "circular", keeping track of what indices the head and tail were in and using modular arithmetic.

We also had to write a class that tested our implementation.
It wasn't specified that it had to use JUnit, but I decided to use it to write my test class.
